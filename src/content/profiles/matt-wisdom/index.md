Somewhere along the way I had developed an interest in conservation, and everything that I did in the gardens that I worked in, I tried to gear towards wildlife in some way. In 2019, I took a job as a plantsman at Marwell Zoo which blended these interests of mine into a single role. I was also due to travel to Kenya to do some volunteering with a primate sanctuary, but as I was preparing for my trip, Covid showed up, and like so many other people my plans went awry. My contract at Marwell at an end and the world in lockdown, I enrolled myself on a postgraduate diploma in Anthropology at Oxford Brookes with a specific interest in primatology and conservation. 

The diploma culminated in a small project looking at plant use in lemurs as a way to aid reforestation efforts in Madagascar – again a combination of my horticultural background and interest in wildlife conservation. I was planning to go on with this research and complete an MSc, but since travel to Africa and Madagascar is currently still not an option, I decided to focus on conservation here in the UK. Currently, my time is spent studying for a Diploma in Habitat Management, running my horticultural business, and doing as much volunteering for local conservation groups and Trusts that I have time for! 

Ultimately, I would like to blend my background and expertise in horticulture with wildlife conservation, either abroad or in the UK. The route to where I am today has been – let’s say scenic! – but the variety of things that I have done since leaving college has actually proved to be the thing that has allowed me to take on new challenges.
