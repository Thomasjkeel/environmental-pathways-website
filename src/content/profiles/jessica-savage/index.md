I’ve never really known what career I wanted to pursue. I remember going to career events at school and feeling daunted by the number of options and being unable to decide which job I would enjoy the most. I always enjoyed Maths and Science, but I also loved reading, languages, and being outdoors. I decided to study Natural Sciences at the University of Durham, because it gave me a lot of flexibility in the subjects I chose, allowing me to study Maths, Physics, and even German. During my undergraduate, I took part in a volunteering programme in the Philippines, doing fish and coral surveys to feed into a wider database looking at the changes of the reef over time. This gave me my first taste of fieldwork and marine conservation, and I never looked back!


When I finished my undergraduate, I decided to reorient myself towards Biology and Conservation, so I started the Erasmus Mundus MSc in Tropical Biodiversity and Ecosystems (Tropimundo). This was an international MSc based in Brussels, and I got to study in Belgium, Italy and Australia. My MSc thesis looked at the impacts of a marine heatwave on plankton communities around Western Australia, combining modelling and marine biology.


When I finished my Masters, I wasn’t too sure I wanted to do a PhD, because I hadn’t really found that niche topic that I would be happy spending 3 years studying. Instead, I applied for lots of graduate jobs, and ended up working in Technology and Cybersecurity for 4.5 years. While I loved my time there and learnt lots of skills I wouldn’t necessarily have in academia (commercial skills, negotiation, stakeholder management), I missed learning, science, and being with like-minded people, so I applied for the London NERC DTP. This PhD programme is unique in that, unlike other programmes, you don’t need a project to apply with. Instead, you spend the first six months building a project that matches your interests and skills. Perfect when you can’t decide which science you like best!


My PhD is investigating the impacts of plastic pollution, including microplastics and macroplastics (such as discarded fishing gear), on manta rays in the Central Indian Ocean. It is a very multidisciplinary project, which suits me perfectly, as I get to learn lots of new exciting things! I will be modelling the pathways of plastics, to try and identify their sources. Then I will look at the risks to manta ray populations for ingestion of microplastics, and entanglement in abandoned fishing gear. Finally, I hope to go out to the Indian Ocean, to measure the plastics in the water, in the plankton they feed on, and even in the manta rays themselves. 


I would always recommend following what interests you and makes you happy. Had I done a PhD straight after my Masters, I probably wouldn’t have enjoyed it as much as I am now. As much as the decision to work for a few years, and then leave a job that I was very comfortable in, to jump into the unknown was scary, I’m so happy I took the leap of faith, as I couldn’t be happier with the way things worked out!
